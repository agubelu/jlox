# jlox

Java interpreter for the lox programming language, from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

My implementation has a few minor syntax changes to make myself happy:
- `nil` -> `null`
- `fun` -> `fn`
- `var` -> `let`

And some additions, such as:

- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` operators
